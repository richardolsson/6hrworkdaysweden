This is a micro-site about the rumor that Sweden has transitioned to a
six-hour workday, located at [6hrworkdaysweden.com][1]. The rumor is not
true, although the socialist and feminist party Vänsterpartiet has long
been working to make the six-hour workday a reality.

## Who am I?
My name is Richard Olsson, and I'm an activist and member of the Swedish
party Vänsterpartiet. Other than that, there is no connection between the
party and this micro-site.

## Want to make changes to the site?
If you want to make the micro-site look nicer, or update the information,
just submit a pull-request and it is likely that I will merge it.
