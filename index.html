            <h1>Does Sweden have six-hour workdays?</h1>
            <h2>No, not yet</h2>
            <p>
                But the socialist and feminist party 
                <a href="http://vansterpartiet.se">Vänsterpartiet</a>
                are working to make it happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                In many places where Vänsterpartiet are part of the local
                government, such as in Gothenburg, trials are already taking
                place in select public workplaces.
